class AnsibleDictProxy(MutableMapping, AnsibleObjectProxyMixin):
    """
    Abstract mapping that wraps a dict, transforming keys and values before
    returning them.

    Subclasses must provide a callable attribute `transform`, which will be called on
    values and keys before returning them. `transform` will NOT be called on keys or values
    that are passed in (i.e. we assume `hash(transform(key)) == hash(key)`), nor when
    returning them in the futue.

    `transform` may optionally accept a boolean `resolve`, enabling a method
    `AnsibleDictProxy.resolve` which returns the underlying dict with
    transform applied to it and `resolve=True`, enabling deep resolution of the proxy.
    This is not used currently.

    Exceptions raised in `transform` will propagate.

    Implementations Details:
    - A cache is used to store transformed values (but not keys) on the assumption that value lookups
      are quite common (and that `transform` might be expensive for them). This means that `transform`
      should be idempotent and that you should not depend on it being called for every lookup (only the first).
    - The cache also enables us to Mind Our Own Business, returning values that reside in the cache
      (and so all values set directly by the user) unaltered.
    - `__eq__` compares the underlying dictionaries to avoid `transform`ing as much as possible. i.e. we assume
      `transform(value) == value`
    - `copy` does not preserve the cache, but pickling and unpickling does

    Known Uses:
    - AnsibleUnsafeDict: inherits from AnsibleUnsafe with `transform` set to `wrap_var`
    - template.AnsibleContext.dict_proxy: `transform` marks the Jinja Context as unsafe when an unsafe
                                          key or value is fetched. If the value is a dict, rewrap it.
